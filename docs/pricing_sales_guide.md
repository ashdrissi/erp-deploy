# Pricing Sales Guide

## Daily Workflow

1. Open or create a `Pricing Scenario`.
2. Add expenses in business order (sequence).
3. Create `Pricing Sheet`, select customer + scenario.
4. Add lines manually or through `Add from Bundle`.
5. Use `Recalculate` or `Queue Recalculate`.
6. Review warnings and line breakdown details.
7. Use `Generate Quotation` and confirm in preview.

## Practical Tips

- Keep manual overrides only for exceptions.
- Watch `Expense Impact` to identify major drivers.
- Use grouped output for summarized quotations.
- Use detailed output for technical offers.

## Troubleshooting

- Missing base prices: run `Refresh Base Prices` and verify Item Price setup.
- Strict guard blocks save: adjust margin rules or override logic.
- Grouped quote fails: configure `Pricing Group Line Item` in Selling Settings.
